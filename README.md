# 2D to 3D Point Cloud Image Generator

This small project utilizes Hugging Face pretrained models to generate a 3D point cloud image from a 2D image.

## How to Use

1. **Setup Environment:**
   - Create a virtual environment for the project.
   - Install all the necessary packages using the following command:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Run the Project:**
   - After installing the required packages, simply run the following command:
     ```
     python main.py "path/to/2D/image"
     ```
   Replace `"path/to/2D/image"` with the actual path to your 2D image file.
